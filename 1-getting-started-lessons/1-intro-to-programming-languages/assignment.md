## Answer

Web developers utilize various tools to enhance their workflow, streamline development, and ensure high-quality web applications. Here are three client-side tools not covered in the provided lesson:

1. **Linters**
2. **Transpilers**
3. **Package Managers**

#### 1. Linters

**Why a web developer would use it:**
Linters analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. They help maintain code quality and consistency, catching errors early in the development process.

**Example Tool: ESLint**

#### 2. Transpilers

**Why a web developer would use it:**
Transpilers convert code written in one programming language into another. For instance, they can convert modern JavaScript (ES6+) into older versions (ES5) to ensure compatibility with older browsers.

**Example Tool: Babel**

#### 3. Package Managers

**Why a web developer would use it:**
Package managers help developers manage project dependencies, allowing them to easily install, update, and remove libraries and frameworks. They also help ensure that all team members work with the same set of dependencies.

**Example Tool: Yarn**
